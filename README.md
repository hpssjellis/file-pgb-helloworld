===================

Makes an Android Phonegap Build file openner for files in the main directory of your sd card.




JAN 15, 2014. update

It you want the Phonegap API method of using 4 seperate functions to read a file then replace 
index.html with indexNoJQuery.html   

The index.html that I have made uses jQuery style funtion definitions

Normal Javascript

function myStuff(){

}


jQuery javascript

function (){

}



jQuery allows you to nest functions and not give them function names. Normally I dislike how every example on the web uses jQuery for things that are easy with normal javascript, but in this situation the nested functions are a huge saving in simplicity.
